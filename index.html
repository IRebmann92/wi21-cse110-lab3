<h3><strong> here is a brief introduction of who I am  </strong><img src="https://htmlcodeeditor.com/images/smiley.png" alt="smiley" /></h3>

<p>I am a 28 year old transfer student at UCSD from just outside of Chicago. I was stationed in California back in 2010 when I joined the USMC as a weapons mechanic till 2014. I joined the service so I could better understand who I was and what I was capable of. In addition I wanted to obtain the GI bill so I could get finacial assistance to go to university when the time came. My main goals in life are to create, explore and help people. I love to build anything from software to lighting fixtures. I started wood working seriously when I bought a 1980s school bus to turn into a rv that I traveled the states in. I aslo travled the states by motorcycle. I have also traveled to many countries to explore cities and others to hike mountains. I bought a house in 2015 and have since been interested in renovation and investing in properties. After this I started my path on higher education and intrestest in the tech fields  I love all programming languages and see them as tools to complete tasks. Some work better than others for given tasks. I mainly use python, java, c and c++
below is a link to my instagram to see some cool stuff I have done and seen!

  <p> I would like to fly into Buenos Aires to exlpore the city and surrounding areas then fly to the southern part of the country and work my way up to patagonia where I would hike around the park (W hike).
