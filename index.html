<h3><strong> here is a brief introduction of who I am  </strong><img src="https://htmlcodeeditor.com/images/smiley.png" alt="smiley" /></h3>
<p class="inset">
  I am a transfer student at UCSD from just outside of Chicago.
  I was stationed in California back in 2010 when I joined the USMC as a
  weapons mechanic till 2014. I joined the service so I could better understand
  who I was and what I was capable of. In addition I wanted to obtain the GI bill
  so I could get finacial assistance to go to university when the time came.
  My main goals in life are to create, explore and help people. I love to build, 
  anything from software to lighting fixtures. I started wood working seriously 
  when I bought a 1980s school bus to turn into a rv that I traveled the states in. 
  I also travled the states by motorcycle. I have also traveled to many countries 
  to explore cities and others to hike mountains. I bought a house in 2015 and 
  have since been interested in the renovation and investing in properties. 
  After this I started my path on higher education and intrestest in the tech fields.
  I love all programming languages and see them as tools to complete tasks.
  Some work better than others for given tasks. I mainly use python, java, c and c++.
below is a link to my instagram to see some cool stuff I have seen!
